# Part 4: Testing Express Servers, User Administration

This part of the course expands on backend development with Node.js and Express. Key topics include:
- Writing unit and integration tests for backend applications (e.g., using Jest/Supertest).
- Structuring Express applications for better maintainability and testability.
- User authentication and authorization (e.g., with JWT).
- Advanced Mongoose usage and database schema design.

The main project in this part is typically a **Blog List application**, which involves creating a REST API for managing blog posts and users.
