# Part 5: Testing React Apps

This part of the course shifts focus to frontend testing, specifically for React applications. Key topics include:
- Unit testing React components.
- Integration testing frontend functionalities.
- End-to-end (E2E) testing user interactions.
- Using testing libraries and tools such as Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, or Playwright.
- Best practices for writing maintainable and effective tests for frontend applications.

The main project in this part is the **Blog List Frontend**, which interacts with the Blog List API built in Part 4. This project will involve implementing tests for its components and user workflows.
