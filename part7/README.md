# Part 7: React Router, Custom Hooks, Styling and Webpack

This part of the course covers several important aspects of developing more complex React applications:

- **React Router**: Implementing client-side routing to enable navigation between different views or pages within a single-page application (SPA). This includes concepts like route definition, dynamic routes, and programmatic navigation.
- **Custom Hooks**: Creating reusable stateful logic by extracting component logic into custom hooks. This helps in keeping components lean and sharing functionality across different parts of the application.
- **Styling React Applications**: Exploring various approaches to styling React components, ranging from traditional CSS and CSS Modules to more advanced techniques like styled-components or utility CSS frameworks (though the specific focus might vary).
- **Webpack (Conceptual)**: While Vite is used in many exercises for its speed and ease of use, this part might touch upon the role and concepts of module bundlers like Webpack, which are crucial for understanding how modern JavaScript applications are built and optimized (even if not directly configured in the exercises). The Full Stack Open course often explains Webpack's role even when using Vite.

The exercises typically involve building or refactoring applications to incorporate these concepts.
